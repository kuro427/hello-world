Hi Humans!

I am Kat, I have always had an interest in coding and I have recently freed up the time to be able to commit to it! Most of my ''experience'' is in C# and C+ though that's limited for now. 
Asian food is my absolute favorite, second is Italian. I am married, my wife's name is Erin! She is in the culinary line of work. I love to game, read, & farm.
